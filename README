1. Introduction

   JUMP-linux is a Software Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM) for Linux.

   It is based on JUMP [1] which, in turn, is based on JIAJIA 1.1.
   According to [1] JUMP has better performance of JIAJIA either version 
   1.1 and 2.1.

   This version has been modified to run only on modern Linux systems, 
   supporting both the x86 and ARM architectures.

   The copyright is specified by the COPYING file.

2. Build

   Edit the ARCH_FLAGS variable in the main Makefile and either add -DARCH_X86
   or -DARCH_ARM based on your specific platform.

   Then, type "make"

3. Configuration

   3.1 Edit ~/.jiahosts and add the list of enabled hosts:

       <hostname> <username> XXX

   3.2 Add the enabled hosts to ~/.rhosts as well:

       <hostname> <username>

4. Usage

   Some examples of usage are available in the apps/ directory.

5. Run

   The application binary must be put and started from <username>'s home
   directory.

   To enable automatic login between the machines:

        mkdir .ssh
        cd .ssh
        ssh-keygen -t rsa
        cat id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<machine> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
