1. Introduction

   JUMP-linux is a Software Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM) for Linux.

   It is based on JUMP (http://www.snrg.cs.hku.hk/srg/html/jump.htm) which, in
   turn, is based on JIAJIA 1.1

   This version only supports the Linux OS and the x86 and ARM architectures.

2. Build

   Edit the ARCH_FLAGS variable in the main Makefile and either add -DARCH_X86
   or -DARCH_ARM based on your specific platform.

   Then, type "make"

3. Configuration

   3.1 Edit ~/.jiahosts and add the list of enabled hosts:

       <hostname> <username> XXX

   3.2 Add the enabled hosts to ~/.rhosts as well:

       <hostname> <username>

4. Run

   The application binary must be put and started from <username>'s home
   directory.

   To enable automatic login between the machines:

        mkdir .ssh
        cd .ssh
        ssh-keygen -t rsa
        cat id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<machine> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
